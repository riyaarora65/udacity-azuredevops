The most important aspect of Data Wrangling is to **clean** or **transform** the data, preparing it for analysis.  
One main issue is having **missing data** while conducting the analysis, which can skew or bias results.   
The first thing to do is to always identify the missing values within the datasetv [Panda Docs](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.isnull.html).  
Once you have found the missing data, you can do the following.
- If there are columns with a few rows of missing data, the Dropna method [Dropna](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.dropna.html) could be used to drop the missing rows. 
- If there are rows with missing data, the Fillna method [Fillna]( https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.17.0/generated/pandas.DataFrame.fillna.html) can be used instead of dropping them completely. 
  *Note: This method can vary with the data and the project.*
