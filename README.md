The most important aspect of Data Wrangling is to clean or transform the data, preparing it for analysis.
One main issue is having missing data while conducting the analysis, which can skew or bias results. The first thing to do is to always identify the missing values within the datasetv[Panda Docs](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.isnull.html).
Once you have found the missing data, you can do the following.
- If there are columns with a few rows of missing data, the Dropna method [Dropna] (http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.dropna.html) could be used to drop the missing rows. 
- If there are rows with missing data, the Fillna method [Fillna] ( http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.17.0/generated/pandas.DataFrame.fillna.html) can be used instead of dropping them completely. 
  Note: This method can vary with the data and the project.
